# Sparky Engine

Sparky Engine is a lightweight graphics engine built using **OpenGL** for rendering and **GLM** for mathematical operations. This project showcases a variety of rendering techniques and includes features designed for flexibility and performance.

## Features

- **Batch Rendering**: Efficiently render multiple objects in a single draw call.
- **Simple Rendering**: Supports straightforward rendering for individual objects.
- **Layers and Groups**: Organize rendering elements into manageable layers and groups.
- **Transformation Stack**: Handle complex transformations with a stack-based approach.

## Roadmap

Planned additions for future updates:
- **Texture Support**: Incorporate textures for richer visuals.
